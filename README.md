# Web App Manager
A tool for creating Web Apps.

Currently it only supports Google Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft Edge, Brave and Firefox.

# Steps for installing:
1) Clone or download the code.
2) If downloaded then extract it to a folder, if cloned then just skip this step.
3) Execute the "installer.sh" script as root.
4) Once installed, you can just search for it or find it in the applications directory.

### Thanks a lot to Larysa Vlach for the icon base.
